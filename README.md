# Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to predict **customer churn** (whether a customer is likely to leave a service) using machine learning techniques.  
The model is trained on historical customer data with demographic and usage features to identify key drivers of churn.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  

## ✨ Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Feature engineering to improve model performance  
- Machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest  
- Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC  

## 📊 Results
- Achieved **XX% accuracy** and **YY ROC-AUC** with Random Forest (replace with your actual results).  
- Identified top churn-driving features such as [e.g., tenure, monthly charges, contract type].
